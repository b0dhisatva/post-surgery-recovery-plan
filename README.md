# Post-Surgery Recovery Plan

This project provides a simple web interface for tracking recovery protocols.

## Customizing Legend Colors and Injectable List

The protocol table uses color-coded lines to differentiate injectable and oral compounds.
To change these colors, edit the Tailwind utility classes in the legend section of
`index.html`. Injectable compounds are controlled by the `injectableKeys` set in
`index.html`; modify this set to adjust which items show the injectable color.
